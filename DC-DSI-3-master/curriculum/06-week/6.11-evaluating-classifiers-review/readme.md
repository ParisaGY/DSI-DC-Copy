Learning Objectives

Today will focus on reviewing classification evaluation, plus an emphasis on precision and recall. Students will be able to:

- Accurately describe the flaws associated with using accuracy alone
- Define the elements of a confusion matrix
- Describe how each of those elements plays into additional metric evaluation: precision, recall, F1 score

We'll predominantly use the notebook included with this lesson. It will serve as a useful reference for your data science career.

We'll also walkthrough [precision-recall curves](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_precision_recall.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-precision-recall-py) in the sklearn documentation.
