## Exploring python-mle

Once installed, go through and explore the python-mle package.

1. Run the code from the readme here: https://github.com/ibab/python-mle. Did your optimization terminate successfully? What are the values of a, b, and sigma you got? How would you interpret these?

2. Expand upon this. Generate more variables with wider ranges. What do you notice about a, b, sigma, and any additional parameters you've created?

3. Examine the source documentation for this. It's less robust than what you've previously seen. By going through the documentation, what models and distributions does this package support? What tests does this support?

4. Based on data you've created, run a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Research this test. What are the results from your test, and what does this tell you from a practical standpoint?
