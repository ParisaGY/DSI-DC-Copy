If you like Bayesian ideas but want to learn more/solidify your understanding, check this out: http://jamessample.github.io/enviro_mod_notes/ (Despite the link, it's not just about environmental statistics, but those interested in spatiotemporal projects and work will likely be heavily Bayesian-oriented.) This will be a great buildup from the most basic aspects of statistics/distributions all the way to MCMC, so you could learn a lot that we, because of time, simply can't get into. Within these notes, there are also some **excellent** iPython notebooks with neat 2D and 3D visualizations available.

Also, I'm trolling StackOverflow and found lots of people posting references for introductions to MCMC. These will be more rigorous than the link above but could still be useful references: http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/256290/basic-references-on-mcmc-for-bayesian-statistics



## If you're starting wanting MCMC video resources (and some notes)...

### First, some intution:

This 18min [video lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12eZWG0Z5gY) nicely describes the problem and the WHY of MCMC. It's hard to predict crazy probability distributions across a ton of features! The video also delves into the intuition behind it.

### Alright, some heavier intro stuff (Optional)

If you like video lecture, MIT OpenCourseWare has two video lectures ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkbkEtOOC1Y)) ([2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZulMqrvP-Pk)) on MCMC.

### Okay, now lecture notes (Optional)

We have the intuition. Let's take a mathematical look via this [Cornell lecture](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/selman/cs475/lectures/intro-mcmc-lukas.pdf). It's math heavy.


### Wrapping it up

Let's talk about some text resources. This [blog post](https://jeremykun.com/2015/04/06/markov-chain-monte-carlo-without-all-the-bullshit/) helps those who aren't a fan of the statistical notation. 

We'll complement that with a GREAT overview of MCMC AND its application in Python. [Grand slam](http://twiecki.github.io/blog/2015/11/10/mcmc-sampling/)

And finally, a more thorough, [deeper Python implementation](https://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/MCMC.html) of MCMC sampling.
