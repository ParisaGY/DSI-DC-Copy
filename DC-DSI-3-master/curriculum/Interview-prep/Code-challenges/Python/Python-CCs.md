# Technical Interview Sample Questions

### Challenge 1.1: Largest Palindrome
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

### Challenge 1.2: Summation of primes
The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17. Find the sum of all the primes below two million.

### Challenge 1.3: Multiples of 3 and 5
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### Challenge 2: Fizz Buzz
Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Fizz", for multiples of 5 print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz". Bonus: If that's too easy, create three unique solutions. Sometimes you'll encounter unexpected constraints, so make sure you're able to think creatively!


### Challenge 3: String Compressor
Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string 'aabcccccaaa' would become a2b1c5a3. If the “compressed” string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z). Specify whether your solution is case sensitive or insensitive, and what you would need to change to make it the other.


### Challenge 4: Unique Characters
Implement an algorithm to determine if each character in a string is unique. Do this 5 ways.


### Challenge 5: Magic Index
A magic index in an array A[0…n-1] is defined to be an index such that A[i] = i. Given a sorted array of distinct integers, write a method to find a magic index, if one exists, in array A. Bonus: What if the values are not distinct? Bonus 2: What if there is more than one magic index?


### Challenge 6: Power Sets
Write a method to return all subsets within a set, including the empty set. E.g. input: [1,2,3] returns [[],[1],[2],[3],[1,2],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]

### Challenge 7: Minimum Distance
Given two arrays of integers, compute the pair of values (one value in each array) with the smallest (non-negative) difference. Return the difference. E.g. input: [1, 3, 15, 11, 2], [23, 127, 235, 19, 8] returns 3 (the difference between 11 and 8)


### Challenge 8: Count the Twos
Write a method to count the number of 2s that appear in all the numbers between 0 and n (inclusive). E.g. Input: 25, Output: 9 (2, 12, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 - notice that 22 counts for two 2s)


### Challenge 9: Longest Words
Given a list of words, write a program to find the longest word made of other words in the list. E.g. Input: [cat, banana, dog, nana, walk, walker, dogwalker] returns ‘dogwalker’
