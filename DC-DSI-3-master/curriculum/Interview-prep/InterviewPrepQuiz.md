**1. When would I use a Python dictionary to store data, instead of another data structure?**


**2. When writing Python code, why would you write a function?**   


**3. I have a Python list named mylist. What is the difference between `sorted(mylist)` and `mylist.sort()`?**   


**4. I have a Pandas DataFrame named users. One of the Series is named age. I run this code: `users[users.age > 25]`. What does this code return, and how does it "work"?**


**5. What is the difference between a bar plot and a histogram?**


 **6. What is the difference between regression and classification problems, and how can you convert a regression problem into a classification problem?**


**7. When Netflix predicts the number of stars that you will use to rate a movie, are they solving a regression or classification problem?**


**8. What's wrong with training and testing a machine learning model on the same data?**


**9. What is the purpose of model evaluation procedures that "hold out" data, like train/test split and cross-validation?**


**10. What are a few metrics (single numbers) I might use to evaluate how well a regression model is doing?  Include scoring criteria and what is considered when calculating the each metric**


**11. Why is a confusion matrix useful for evaluating the performance of a classifier?**


 **12. I built a machine learning model to solve a binary classification problem. The accuracy of my classifier is 99%, and the AUC is 0.51. Is my model doing well? Why or why not?**


**13. With regard to machine learning models, why should I care the about bias-variance trade-off?**


**14. How does regularization reduce overfitting?**


**15. What are a few advantages and disadvantages of decision trees, as compared to other machine learning models?**
