## Weekly Student Teaches

### Overview
Each week 2-3 students will give an instructional exercise to their peers.
Topics will be assigned Wednesday mornings and will be due the following Wednesday morning.
The Instructional portion should not last more than 10 minutes.

### Objective:
You are in the process of training new employees at your place of work.  Some of them work directly with you, but some work for another (less technical) department.  During their 10 minute attention span, you will have to explain to them an overview of the fundamental concept and how it is used in your line of work/position.

- __Part I.__

You should be prepared to explain the topic that you are give as if you were speaking to an audience with minimal technical	understanding.
You will also be expected to explain any additional ‘micro’ details that will be relevant for part II.

- __Part II.__

Explain the use-case scenario in which the topic you are discussing can be applied to a field that you work in or used to work in.
If you can not think of anything from a previous or current field you	may create one for a field you wish to or plan to pursue.

Students should come prepared with enough subject matter expertise to answer any questions your colleagues (Instructors, Classmates, Outcomes) may have regarding the topic and use.
While these exercises are intended for review, and identifying practical application we highly encourage using these exercises as a means of topic enrichment.

Please come prepared with any resources that may be necessary whether they be slides, notebooks, code examples or faux data.
